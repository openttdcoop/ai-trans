## Versioning

We uses rolling release model with YYMMDD format for versioning. This number is generated by script [bundle.ps1](https://github.com/fanioz/AI-Trans/blob/master/bundle.ps1) according to the latest commit date. If you are cloning the AI directly to ai folder, you will get the version number years ahead as written in [info.nut](info.nut).
